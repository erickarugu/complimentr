# Complimentr

An online platform that enables colleagues and teammates to write each other anonymous "digital notes" to keep one another motivated. We all need some to regularly compliment us to keep us psyched up. In the modern days most people spend much of their time on screens and this is the source of motivation for this project.
Inspired by physical sticky notes.
